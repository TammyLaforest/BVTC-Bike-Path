It is a premium bikeway in Rhode Island. \n\n\t Extending your enjoyment on-road adds several more miles to India Point in Providence and then to Bristol to the south with another 18 miles off-road cycling. Travel to the north into Massachusetts where more off-road cycling awaits. The Blackstone River Bikeway is clearly marked with signs./n Visitors can easily get on or off at multiple locations along the route, accommodating any distance or areas visitors wish to experience."

The Blackstone River Bikeway can be used for recreation, sightseeing or exercise. It is a fun way to go to the library or city hall, shop at some unique stores, view the natural beauty of the river, and stop and taste the many delicious cultural foods the Valley has to offer.\n\t We are excited about our special area along the Blackstone River and hope you will stop and explore while you are on the bikeway."
